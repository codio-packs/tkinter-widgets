# For some reason, the 'xview' method of Entry class does not work
# like the 'xview' methods of other widgets. It accepts only an 'index'
# argument, instead of the usual variable-lebgth list.
# Therefore, doing the usual scrollbar['command']=entry.xview generates
# an error (wrong number of arguments) every time the scrollbar is
# moved.
# To bypass this, I created my own subclass of Entry widget,
# to which I added an 'xview2' method, which I can use instead od xview
