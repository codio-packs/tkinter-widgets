## TKinter Widgets
Once your project opens, you can quickly play with this in one of 2 ways using the 'Rocket' menu item. This is the menu item with a rocket next to it.

**Warning:** the demo code is pretty flaky and crashes easily, so if it stops working, look at the terminal window and you'll probably see it has crashed, so simply restart as per the instructions below.

### Individual python file
If you want to experiment with a specific python file, follow these steps.

1. Open a python file in the file tree (try canvasplot.py) 
2. In the Codio menu is a button with a rocket icon. Drop the menu down and select 'Start current'. This will run the python file in a new terminal window.
2. From the neighbouring menu item to the right, press 'View widget demo'. The view should open up. 
3. Do not close the empty dialog in the viewer or it will terminate the python process, which you will need to restart the process. This is a 'feature' of the demo code and has nothing to do with Codio.

### Full Widget Demo
If you want to choose the widget demo from a menu via the viewer, then follow these steps.

1. In the Codio drop down menu item with the rocket icon, select 'Start widget.py'.
2. From the neighbouring menu item, press 'View widget demo'.
